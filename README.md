<hr>
<p>This repository is intended for the documentation of a Django project requested during a job application process. 
The basic specification for the project is to create a form for entering voucher codes. The site would then inform the user whether the voucher code is valid.
If it is valid, the amount of discount would then be displayed. In addition, each voucher code can only be used for 3 times only.
Using the same code for more than 3 times would result in the voucher code being invalid.</p>
